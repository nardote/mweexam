### Reusability 
Make components thinking for reutilization.
Make documentation for easy reuse.

If some components use same code. Put the code in a file to import it.
### Coment code

### Choice a good name for components
First letter capitalize (UpperCamelCase).

### Use existing components
There is a lot of pages with good components
